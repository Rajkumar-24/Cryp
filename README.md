# CRYPTOMETER
Summary:
I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive cryptocurrency market tracking application that delivers real-time data analysis and portfolio management capabilities. Leveraging the power of the AXIOS library, the app seamlessly retrieves and updates data from the server, ensuring users have access to the latest information. To optimize state management across the application, I skillfully implemented the Context API and Recoil library, enabling efficient and streamlined global state management.

One of the key highlights of the application is its user-centric approach. Users are empowered to create and manage their own portfolios, allowing them to tailor their investment strategies and preferences. The app provides a personalized experience, offering a range of features and tools that cater to individual investment goals.

In addition to its data-driven functionalities, the application also integrates advanced charting capabilities. Users can easily visualize and analyze the historical performance of various cryptocurrencies, enabling them to make informed investment decisions.

Overall, the cryptocurrency market tracking application combines cutting-edge technologies, robust data analysis, and intuitive portfolio management features to deliver a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors.
